Current PyPhoto data processing functionalities

Capabilities implemented:
- Fermi level correction
- Basic k-space conversion
- Merging data
- Normalising
- Background subtraction
- Symmetrisation about a certain energy or single value in another axis
- Smoothing (Gaussian convolution)
- Derivative functions (2nd derivative, 1d and 2d curvature, minimum gradient methods)
- Rotation of 2D data

Further instructures on how to use these are included in the various Jupyter notebook files saved in the example/process folder.
