	abstract = {The last decade witnessed significant progress in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and its applications. Today,ARPES experiments with 2-meV energy resolution and 0.2¡angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled ARPES to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-Tc superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent ARPES results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds,with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues,such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface,the superconducting gap,the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion,evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase separation,the emergence of coherent quasiparticles through the superconducting transition,and many-body effects in the one-particle spectral function due to the interaction of the charge with magnetic and/or lattice degrees of freedom. Given the dynamic nature of the field,we chose to focus mainly on reviewing the experimental data,as on the experimental side a general consensus has been reached,whereas interpretations and related theoretical models can vary significantly. The first part of the paper introduces photoemission spectroscopy in the context of strongly interacting systems,along with an update on the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides an overview of the scientific issues relevant to the investigation of the low-energy electronic structure by ARPES. The rest of the paper is devoted to the experimental results from the cuprates,and the discussion is organized along conceptual lines: normal-state electronic structure,interlayer interaction,superconducting gap,coherent superconducting peak,pseudogap,electron self-energy,and collective modes. Within each topic,ARPES data from the various copper oxides are presented.},

	abstract = {The role of X-ray based electron spectroscopies in determining chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties of solids has been well-known for several decades. A powerful approach is angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, whereby the kinetic energy and angle of photoelectrons emitted from a sample surface are measured. This provides a direct measurement of the electronic band structure of crystalline solids. Moreover, it yields powerful insights into the electronic interactions at play within a material and into the control of spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, central pillars of future solid state science. With strong recent focus on research of lower-dimensional materials and modified electronic behavior at surfaces and interfaces, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy has become a core technique in the study of quantum materials. In this review, we provide an introduction to the technique. Through examples from several topical materials systems, including topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides, and transition metal oxides, we highlight the types of information which can be obtained. We show how the combination of angle, spin, time, and depth-resolved experiments are able to reveal "hidden" spectral features, connected to semiconducting, metallic and magnetic properties of solids, as well as underlining the importance of dimensional effects in quantum materials.},

Given the recent developments on spatially resolved ARPES (ARPES: angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy), the information on the spatial inhomogeneity on the local electronic structure is now accessible. However, the next challenge becomes apparent as the conventional analysis encounters difficulty handling a large volume of a spatial mapping dataset, typically generated in the spatially resolved ARPES experiments. Here, we propose a machine-learning-based approach using unsupervised clustering algorithms (K-means and fuzzy-c-means) to examine the spatial mapping dataset. Our analysis methods enable automated categorization of the spatial mapping dataset with a much-reduced human intervention and workload, thereby allowing quick identification and visualization of the spatial inhomogeneity on the local electronic structures.},

Advances in light sources for ARPES experiments are currently leading to a vast increase of data acquisition rates and data quantity. On the other hand, access time to the most advanced ARPES instruments remains strictly limited, calling for fast, effective, and on-the-fly data analysis tools to exploit this time. In response to this need, we introduce ARPESNet, a versatile autoencoder network that efficiently summmarises and compresses ARPES datasets. We train ARPESNet on a large and varied dataset of 2-dimensional ARPES data extracted by cutting standard 3-dimensional ARPES datasets along random directions in k. To test the data representation capacity of ARPESNet, we compare k-means clustering quality between data compressed by ARPESNet, data compressed by discrete cosine transform, and raw data, at different noise levels. ARPESNet data excels in clustering quality despite its high compression ratio.},

	abstract = {In spectroscopic experiments, data acquisition in multi-dimensional phase space may require long acquisition time, owing to the large phase space volume to be covered. In such a case, the limited time available for data acquisition can be a serious constraint for experiments in which multidimensional spectral data are acquired. Here, taking angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) as an example, we demonstrate a denoising method that utilizes deep learning as an intelligent way to overcome the constraint. With readily available ARPES data and random generation of training datasets, we successfully trained the denoising neural network without overfitting. The denoising neural network can remove the noise in the data while preserving its intrinsic information. We show that the denoising neural network allows us to perform a similar level of second-derivative and line shape analysis on data taken with two orders of magnitude less acquisition time. The importance of our method lies in its applicability to any multidimensional spectral data that are susceptible to statistical noise.},

Examples include solid-state lighting, touchscreens, batteries, implants, drug delivery and many more. The enormous amount of research data produced every day in these fields represents a gold mine of the twenty-first century. This gold mine is, however, of little value if these data are not comprehensively characterized and made available. How can we refine this feedstock; that is, turn data into knowledge and value? For this, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data 'findable and AI ready' (a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which science is carried out today. In this Perspective, we discuss how we can prepare to make this happen for the field of materials science.},
